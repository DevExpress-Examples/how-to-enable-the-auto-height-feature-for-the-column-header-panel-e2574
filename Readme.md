# How to enable the auto height feature for the column header panel


<strong>In version 14.1, we have added the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#windowsforms/DevExpressXtraGridViewsGridGridOptionsView_ColumnHeaderAutoHeighttopic">GridView.OptionsView.ColumnHeaderAutoHeight property</a> . Set the `ColumnHeaderAutoHeight` property to `true` to wrap the column captions and automatically adjust the column header height. </strong><br/><br/>
## If the built-in ColumnHeaderAutoHeight feature does not suit you, we will be happy to find the most appropriate solution for you if you describe your real-life scenario. Just click   [here](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Create) to submit a ticket to our Support Center.
